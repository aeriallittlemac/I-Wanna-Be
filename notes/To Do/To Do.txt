To Do:
- Camera Follow Points: formerly objects which calculated the X midpoint between two hard coded characters.
- Figure out the purpose of Room Order.
- Dialogue, three types: regular, cutscenes, timed
- The Diamondwood High locker script belongs to 1F and the the bathroom cutscene script belongs to the bathroom.
- Filter folder contents are appropriately grouped in a single folder. Need to determine what spr_white is used for.
- Possible unused assets: spr_sprite_7, TestSet1
- Need to reorganize assets in Objects/General, and maybe Sprites/General
- Left the current arrangement of mixing objects, sprites, and dialogue in School Assets
- Left the current arrangement of UI and VFX

- Test if moving assets around impacted game.
